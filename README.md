# Foundations of the Church in the Old Testament

## 1. Introduction

In this paper would like to look at how the church is reflected in the Old Testament, to see if in the early texts there are hints about the church of Christ and if it would be possible to already understand from those texts what the church and its role would be. 

This would not only be a way to confirm God's plan for those who only read and believe in the Old Testament but also for christians today that we are the Church that Christ desired, God's precious possesion which fulfills its purpose on earth built on the apostles and prophets with Jesus as cornerstone (Ephesians 2:19-21).

To find the roots of the church we will need to engage in a longer journey starting from the begginings of the humankind and following the people of Israel in the old testament. Where a parallel is found between old and new testaments, points will be made on what changed and what remained the same with the comming of Christ and the new convenant.

## 2. How everything started

When Adam and Eve sinned for the first time in the garden of Eden by eating from the forbidden tree, the fellowship with their maker was broken as we can see they were hidding when they heard God was walking through the garden (Genesis 3:6-8). Why did this happen, because they grabbed something mankind can't handle, consciousness. Knowledge of good and evil from a limited perspective ruined the human condition, leaving man with a sense of guilt, angry and alienated with an inner emptiness ever craving and never succeeding to fill (Genesis 3:17-19).

When asked why they ate from the tree they were commanded not to eat, Adam shifted the blame on Eve, and Eve on the serpent instead of repenting and asking forgivness (Genesis 3:11-13). They received their punishment but in the pubishment there was also a profecy or convenant of woman's offspring redeemer that will crush the evil and save humanity. It was not yet revealed that God was planning to sacrifice his only begotten Son practically sacrificing  himself by becomming a man in order to demonstrate that love can undo evil and restore the humand condition and the unity of the creation to it's maker (John 3:20-23). As they were banished from the garden not to eat from the tree of life and have eternal life, God provided them with animal skin garments implying a first sacrifice of animals to account for their sin.  

And these two, the promise of a redeemer and the animal sacrifice are the first glimpses of the future Church of Jesus Christ. 

We can see that the first children of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel were bringing offerings to the Lord as they probably learned from their parents. Now, one could ask himself how an animal sacrifice would work or why would be enough to pay for sins of humans. The sacrifce has two components, first is the admitting of guilt and repentance for sins (which Adam and Eve failed to do in the garden) and second is the blood of a pure animal which is only a valuable life sacrificed as a symbol of the ultimate and love bearing sacrifice (Hebrews 10:4) that was promised in Jesus Christ. We will see in the next passages that this example pointing at the future sacrifice of Jesus will be presented in several places in the old testament. We will also see several examples when an offering was rejected by God as in the case of Cain because it was missing one or both components of the true sacrifice (Genesis 4:5-7), either came from an unrepented, unfaithful heart (Hebrews 11:4) or what was offered didn't obey God's commands.

**One could ask himself why didn't God restore the broken unity and get rid of evil right away? Why is God using the same lost humans that He is trying to save in his plan?** As mentioned above in our limited understanding we probably can't answer this with certainity. We can only see that God considered humanity his precious possesion and in His love didn't want to destroy it. Not only that but humankind received an important role in God's salvation plan. Also we can see that God wanted that people would not be forced into righteousness but choose freely God's love by accepting Christ and in the end would be able to have eternal life and reign again in heaven *Gan Eden* together with their creator.

## 3. God's continued struggle to redeem humanity

Next manifestations of church precursors are in God's struggle to redeem humanity from evil through convenants. First was the covenant with Noah (Genesis 8,9) after the flood with an unconditional promise not to destroy the entire life on earth through flood. On this occasion we see again that Noah built an altar and brought offerings from clean animals. Then it was the Abrahamic convenant (Genesis 12,15,17) later renewed to Jacob that through him and his descendants they will be a blessing for all the people on earth and here we see Israel's mission to bring God's salvation to all nations. In the case of Abraham we are given an even stronger hint towards the sacrifice of Jesus Christ through the example of God testing Abraham's faith by asking him to sacrifice his son Isaac.

Afterwards when the people of Israel reached the mount Sinai led by Moses out of Egypt, God renewed the convenant with Abraham promising to make the people of Israel a kingdom of priests, a holy nation and God'S treasured posession (Exodus 19). Again we have indication for God's salvation plan in the sacrifice of the lamb and the protection of the people houesholds through his blood. In this case the convenant was not unconditional, Moses brought back from his encounter with God on the mountain the law of God that the nation of Israel had to obey in order to prove their allegiance to God and to receive blessings, this was already implying a different type of sacrifice that resonates with Jesus words in John 14:23-24 *Jesus replied, Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching*. 

There are more indications towards the future church in the exodus story, first in the old testament Israel was the chosen nation but this changed in the new testament where in Jesus Christ there are no more barriers to become children of God, Abraham's seed and heirs to the promise (Galatians 3:26-29). Also there is a parallel between the hebrew celebrations in rememberance of the exodus and the main events in the christian church history. The crucifixion of Jesus happened on passover (Pesach) (John 19:14, Luke 22:7-14) when the sacrifice of the lamb and salvation through his blood was celebrated, and Pentecost the birth of the church when the holly spirit descended followed 50 days after the resurection when Shavuot, the giving of the law at mount Sinai, was celebrated.

Following the entrance into the promise land, God establishes a convenant with king David (2 Samuel 7) promising a descendant that will build God's temple and who will rule over God's people and who's throne and kingdom will last forever. This covenant becomes the basis for hope of a Messiah, hebrew meaning the annointed king of Davidic line, and makes sense of the Gospels’ concern to show Jesus/Yeshua hebrew meaning redeemer or deliverer (sharp watcher of the flock), was the rightful King that will deliver God's treasured people from evil. We will see in the profecies that the Messiah was expected by people of those times to restore both the temple and kingdom of David, especially after the people of Israel ended in exile and the temple was destroyed making impossible the offering of sacrifices (Zechariah 6:13).

## 4. Office of the priest

The first mention of a priest in the old testament is in Genesis 14:18 when the King priest of Salem, Melchizedek brought bread and wine and blessed Abraham before God Most High. This is an important passage not only because of the bread and wine symbolistic that resonate with Jesus's last supper but also because in Psalm 110 (most quoted passage of OT in the NT) Jesus is promised as the eternal priest in the order of Melchizedek and confirmed in Hebrews 7:21 that God keeps His promises and Jesus became the assurance of the new covenant forever. He holds his priesthood permanently and is able to save anyone who draws near to God through Him as He lives to make intercession for us (Hebrews 7:24-25). 

Here we can see the role or purpose of the church. As a result of our union with Christ, we are reminded of our Melchizedekian calling to consequently spread the received love of God and desire to save humanity and expand the kingdom of God by proclaiming the gospel of the perfect priest with infinite mercy to the rest of the world.

During the exodus when Moses received the law, he instituted the Aaronic priesthood. So, although the entire nation constituted *a kingdom of priests* the Lord established Aaron's descendants as the perpetual priestly clan in Israel and their tribe of Levi also appointed to help te priests in keeping the proper purity levels of the sanctuary. Moses was the first of the priests as we see in Exodus 24:2-8 he brought offerings after te reading of the law and people of Israel promised to do everything that the LORD has said, he sealed the covenant wit the blood of the sacrifice. The levites had duties like transporting the tabernacle or guarding the gate of the tabernacle and later in the purification procedures and preparing of the offerings at the temple but only the priests were allowed to enter the Holy Place and bring the burnt offerings at the altar, and only the high priest was allowed on the day of attonemet (Yom Kippur) to enther the Holy of Holies or The Most Holy Place to purify the mercy seat on the ark of the covenant by sprinkling the sin offering blood on it and to bring the burnt offering for the sins of the entire nation of Israel.

The Yom-Kippur (Day of attonement) was celebrated at the beginning of each year starting with the exodus from Egypt and arrival at mount Sinai, it marks the culmination of the 10 days of Awe a period of introspection and repentance following the Rosh Hashanah, the jewish new year. It was the most sacred day of the year and on this day the high priest made atonement and asked for God’s forgiveness on behalf of all the people of Israel. We can observe again the two elements of the sacrifice, namely the repentance and asking forgveness of sins and the shedding of pure blood as a symbol of the redemption payment without which a sacrifice would not be accepted. 

It is important also to notice that although in the beginning people brought their own sacrifices, after te the mosaic law was instituted following the exodus, it was the duty of the priests to keep themselves and the sanctuary pure and bring all the types of sacrifices: burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings or guilt offrings but in all cases they din't posses a special power of their own to forgive sins or restore the broken relationship between God and humanity, it was God's grace that was implored before His Presence on the seat of mercy.

After the comming of Jesus the priesthood responsability was given to all believers to bring spiritual sacrifices through Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:4-5, 9-10), no more special class of people to act as institutional priests. And also neither animal sacrifices nor an attonment day are needed as they were only a symbol of the one perpetual sacrifice and attonement of Jesus Christ through which believers are made perfect and eternally holy. More than that the believers are called to follow the example of Jesus and become priests that would sacrifice their own lives for the others as this is the true worship that pleases God (Romans 12:1, Hebrews 13:15-16).

## 5. Office of the king

The kings in Israel were the chosen leaders to protect the nation from outside enemies using either political or military power so they were required to strenghten the defenses and were not allowed to gather great riches for themselves. In the same time they were required to posses a copy of the books of the law of Moses (Torah) (Deuteronomy 17:18-19) and study it daily under the advice of the priests as the King was also the guardian that the nation will follow the covenant and obey the laws of God. Moreover the King was not above the law and the power to judge was given to the priests, levites and prophets which would also oversee that the nation starting with the head upholds the law of God.

There were occasions when the King himself would bring sacrifices acting as a priest (2 Samuel 24:18, 1 Kings 3:4) at the instruction of God through the prophets and there is the negative example of Saul who offered a sacrifice on his own (1 Samuel 10:8) not listening to the instructions of the prophet Samuel to wait 7 days for him loosing in this way the favor in the eyes of God and his establishment as King.

The authority of the King was in governing the gathering of righteous people so that divine justice is guaranteed. In the same time the King who loved his people meant a King that would be ready to become a martyr fighting himself with the enemies as a champion of the people.

As we have sen in previous chapter that all believers were called by Jesus to become self sacrificing priests there is a promise in the new testaments that the believers will inherit and reign the kingdom of Christ becomming kings together with Christ (2 Timothy 2:12, Revelation 5:9-11). Of course this kingdom is not of this earth as people were thinking(Luke 17:20-21, John 18:36) nor any kind of political or economical power through esablishing an institution as it happened in the middle ages history of the church.

## 6. Office of the prophet

Prophets were called to declare God's will or God's Word to the people in case of distress from the enemies or in case the people was worshipping idols. In some cases the King himself needed to be attentioned by the prophets that he didn't fullfill God's will or worshiped idols himself. 

Prophets wer never speaking of their own but only what was revealed to them through the Holy Spirit. Sometimes they would receive other gifts like the power of healing for Elisha healing Naaman. And as in this case we see other cases when prophets ended in the service of foreign Kings or nations like Daniel in Babylon or Jonah in Ninive but again only to fullfil God's will through those Kings or nations.

The work of the prophets should not be confused with that of the *Teachers of the law* who were scribes knowing the Torah and being able to explain it to the people. Also there were cases when some women pretended to be prophets but they were practicing some magic out of their own hearts like in Ezekiel 13:17–23. There were warning also against false prophets that would speak only what people would like to hear for material gain (Jeremiah 32:1–5)

In a lot of prophetic books there is a very clear and profound poiniting towards the comming of the Messiah like in the books of Isaiah or Daniel,  or there are prophetic books that bare a great witness to the Gospel like in the book of Jonah. One interesting case is that of John the Baptist foretold by the Prophet Isaiah (Isaiah 40:3-5) that would come before Jesus to prepare the way of the Lord (John 1:19-34) and who baptized with water but who mentioned that the one wo will come after him will baptize with the Holy Spirit. Now the water immersion was already known to people in Israel from the purification rituals mikvah(Hebrew מִקְוֶה) but his was a preparation for was to became the main calling of the church in making disciples of those baptized or sealed with the Holy spirit symbolized by the baptism with water.

The same as in the case of the priesthood office that was given to all called believers after the comming of Jesus, the gifts of the Holy spirit that were given only to the prophets in the old testament are now available to all believers with the promise of the helper (John 14:12-17) and the call to be filled with the holy spirit (Ephesians 5:18). Also as prophets were made known the will of God and were able to proclaim the comming judgement of God like Jonah or Ezekiel, the same way christians will be able to understand the will of God through the Holy Spirit and they will be able to rightfully judge all things (1 Chorintians 2:11-16)

## 7. God's continued presence

Even with the union broken by the fall of men and latter rebellion of the people of Israel, God didn't stay far from his chosen people. God was present as a pillar of cloud during the day and as a pillar of fire during the night to lead them through the desert (Exodus 13:21). Also during the exodus, God gave instruction to build the Ark of the Covenant as a symbol of the presence of the Lord with the tablets of the law and Aaron's staff (symbol of chosen priesthood) inside and the mercy seat on top of it where God would give instructions to the israelites (Exodus 25:22). Most of the time the ark of the covenant was kept in the Holy of holies inside the tabernacle (Exodus 25-27 tent of meeting) considered the dwelling place of God (mishkan meaning in hebrew: to dwell). Later it was placed in the holy of holies in the temple of Solomon (1 Kings 8:1-66). And the Glory of God's presence (Kabod or Shekinah) filled the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34-35) and the temple (1 Kings 8:11) until the destruction of the temple King Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC (Ezekiel 10:18-19). God's Glory reapeared only at the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem as accounted in Luke 2:9 *An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.* and as it was foretold by the prophet in Isaiah 40:5  *Then the glory of the LORD will be shown, and all people together will see it.*

The terms used in the old testament for assembly or congregation with the purpose of worship or instruction like in Deuteronomy 9:10 to receive the laws are קָהָל qahal
which has the root letters קָל which are the signs of a sun set and a sheperd stuff meaning the sheperd calling his flock at sunset; and עֵדָה edah with root letters עֵד which are the signs for eye and a entry gate or door meaning people gathered to bear witness. Both words must have had a great resonance for the jews and apostles listening the words of Jesus in John 10:7-17 *I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me — just as the Father knows me and I know the Father — and I lay down my life for the sheep.* and in Acts 1:6-8 *But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.* In the greek version of the new testament the term ἐκκλησία ekklesia was used with a similar meaning of those called out and in aramaic version the term edah above as in the old testament was used. 

What changed in the new testament was again that the geographical place of gathering was not the most important thing and the center of faith moved from a stone temple into the heart of the beliver build on the corner stone Jesus Christ (John 4:23) and istead of a geographical gathering, those that are sealed through the holy spirit are God's chosen people (Ephesians 1:13-14). What remains the same even with the new convenant like an absolute constant is the sinners repentance and asking of forgivness as a response to God's love and a first step towards regeneration and unification with Christ (Romans 3:23).

Through the comming of the promised Messiah the convenants from the old testament were fullfiled (Acts 3:21), the price for humankind's sin was paid, evil was defeated, and a new convenant was established (Jeremiah 31:31-34, Luke 22:20, Romans 7:6), salvation is freely available for everyone believing in the risen Son of God pictured at Mount Sinai by all those looking at the bronze snake risen by Moses in the desert (John 3:14-15; Numbers 21:4-9). The curtain of the Jerusalem temple has been torn in two (Matthew 27:51) and the holy of holies, the dwelling place of God has been open to all those unified and cleansed in one Spirit with God (Romans 8:9, Collosians 3:1-4, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13). The broken fellowship from Genesis has been restored (1 Chorintians 15:22, Romans 5:12), the old garden of Eden will be reopened on the new earth and under the new heaven and the church will receive the eternal life that Adam and Eve lost (Romans 6:23) to reign in the new paradise *Gan Eden* (Revelation 21:1-8).

## 8. Conclusion

Hope that the paper managed to shed light on how the church was prepared from the moment man was created and has fallen to be a part in God's redemption plan through unification with Christ the promised redeemer to share the same  mission in saving humanity from evil.
